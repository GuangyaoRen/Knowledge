\chapter*{Preface}
\lettrine{M}{athematical} Analysis is essentially a more rigorous and theoretical exploration of the concepts introduced in Calculus. It delves deeply into functions, sequences, limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration. 

\indent We study Mathematical Analysis because it provides a rigorous framework for understanding other mathematical disciplines, such as differential equations, topology, functional analysis, and more. Additionally, learning Mathematical Analysis enhances the ability to think critically, construct proofs, and work with abstract concepts, which are crucial in mathematics.
